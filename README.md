## About BashPass-DEB

BashPass-DEP is a repository that simplifies the process of building and deploying [BashPass](https://www.github.com/AntonVanAssche/BashPass) and [BashPass-Remote](https://www.github.com/AntonVanAssche/BashPass-Remote) on Debian-based systems, such as Debian, Ubuntu, and Linux Mint, by providing all necessary files and build scripts required to package the applications as Debian packages.
The packages are built using the dpkg-deb tool, which creates binary packages that can be easily installed on Debian-based systems.
The repository includes the necessary control files, patches, and other configuration files required to build the packages.
